/* The CONSOLE is a built into the Chrome browser. It shows
the javascript output the way it's being run by the browser.
You can directly input javascript code to see the output and
to check whether your code works. Click the hamburger menu

An alert is a pop-up window that will be triggered when
a page is accessed. It will prevent a user from using other 
parts of a site until it is closed. Too many alerts can
slow down a person's computer. */


/* A variable stores or holds a value, which can be any data type, the
four basic data types are: string which is a series of characters
the string is always between quotes, number which is a numerical value starting from "0", 
boolean data, which is true or false value, and undefined, which is no value. */

/* var fruitName = "orange";
console.log(fruitName);
variable is fruitName and the value is orange
orange is a STRING */

/*  var x = 2;
var y = 3;
var b = x + y;
console.log(b);
'x' stores the value of 2, and 'y' stores a value of 3, and 
'b' stores the valuable of "x" and "y" when added
whatever the value of x and y may be
the data type in this example is a NUMBER */

/* var num1 = 1;
var num2 = 2;
console.log(num1 === num2);
this is an example of a value comparison, which will always 
return a BOOLEAN true or false. We use "===" because it will 
check for both value and type. */

/* An ARRAY is one variable that has multiple values stored, each value in an array has an index starting from 0,
arrays can hold strings or numbers
var fruits = ["apples", "grapes", "pears","bananas"];
console.log(fruits [3]);
the varable is fruits, there are 4 values for fruit.
in this case bananas has an index of 3 */

/* To test two strings of data you use comparison operators. Comparison operators include:
===	equal value and equal type
!==	not equal value or not equal type
>=	greater than or equal to
>=	greater than or equal to 

You can test your javascript in the console using "console.log()" */

Controls the flow of program

/* Functions
A function is a procedure that performs a speciÔ¨Åc action. You define a function
and then you call it. Defining a function is saying what you want it to do and 
calling a function is telling the function to execute or run.
A function has an argument that is an input specific to that function.
A return value is the result or output after a function is run. A function
is only run once and then it stops. */

/* function alertPrize(doorNum) {
if (doorNum ===1){
alert('won a car');
} else if (doorNum===2) {
alert('you won a vacay');
}

Still very confused by functions. I think I get the concept on paper,
but have difficulty putting them into action. For example I don't get
why when I put in the above example, I can't get the alert to show in 
console. */
